Clone the project to your own machine

Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes
NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
Code can only be merged if 2 reviewers have approved the committed code. Else it will not be merged
Finally, each code has to be tested thoroughly and testing notes must be documented to ensure best solutions are being merged
